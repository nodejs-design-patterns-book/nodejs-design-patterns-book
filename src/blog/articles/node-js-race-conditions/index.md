A single-threaded event loop, like the one used by JavaScript and Node.js, makes it somewhat harder to have race conditions, but race conditions are still possible!

In this article we will explore the topic of race conditions in Node.js. We will discuss some examples and present a few different solutions that can help to make our code _race-conditions free_.


## What is a race condition?

First of all, let's try to clarify what a _race condition_ actually is.

A race condition is a type of _programming error_ that can occur when multiple processes or threads are accessing the same shared resource, for instance a file or a record in a database, and at least one of them is trying to modify the resource.

Let's try to present an example. Imagine that while a process is trying to rename a file, another process is trying to delete the same file. In this case, the system will crash because, when it's trying to delete the file, the file has already been moved to another location. Or, the other way around, while one process is trying to rename the file, the file was already deleted by the other process and it's not available on the filesystem anymore.

In other cases, race conditions can be even more subtle, because they wouldn't result in the program crashing, but they might just be the source of an incorrect or inconsistent behaviour. In these cases, since there is no explicit error and no stack trace, the issue is generally much harder to troubleshoot and fix.

A classic example is when 2 processes are trying to update the same data source and the new value is a function of the current value.

Let's pretend we are building a Roman Empire simulation game in which we can manage some cash flow and we have a global balance in [_aureus_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aureus) (a currency used in the Roman Empire around 100 B.C.E.). Now, let's say that our initial balance is `0` _aurei_ and that there are two independent game components (processes) that are trying to increase the balance by `50` _aurei_ each, we should expect that in the end the balance is `100` _aurei_, right?

```
0 + 50 + 50 = 100 ðŸ¤‘
```

If we implement this in a naive way, we might have the two components performing three distinct operations each:

  1. Read the current value for `balance`
  2. Add `50` _aurei_ to it
  3. Save the resulting value into `balance`

Since the two components are running in parallel, without any synchronisation mechanism, the following case could happen:

## Can we have race conditions in Node.js?

differences around parallelism and concurrency.

explain the event loop quickly.


## A Node.js example with a race condition


```javascript
const delay = (m) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, m))

let accountBalance = 0

async function getAccountBalance () {
  // simulates random delay to retrieve data from a remote source (e.g. a DB)
  await delay(Math.random() * 100)
  return accountBalance
};

async function setAccountBalance (value) {
  // simulates random delay to retrieve data from a remote source (e.g. a DB)
  await delay(Math.random() * 100)
  accountBalance = value
};

async function add$50 (label) {
  const balance = await getAccountBalance()
  console.log(`${label}: get balance`)
  const newBalance = balance + 50
  await setAccountBalance(newBalance)
  console.log(`${label}: set balance`)
};

async function main () {
  const transaction1 = add$50('transaction1') // NOTE no `await`
  const transaction2 = add$50('transaction2') // NOTE no `await`
  await transaction1 // awaiting here does not stop `transaction2` from being scheduled before transaction 1 is completed
  await transaction2
  const balance = await getAccountBalance()
  console.log(`$${balance}`)
};

main()
```

provide simple solution.
