    description1: >
      <strong>Luciano Mammino</strong> is a software engineer born in 1987, the
      same year that the Nintendo released Super Mario Bros in Europe, which by
      chance is his favorite video-game. He started coding at the age of 12
      using his father's old Intel 386, provided only with the DOS operating
      system and the qBasic interpreter.
      After a master's degree in computer science he developed his programming
      skills mostly as a web developer working mainly as freelancer for
      companies and startups all around Italy. After a start-up parenthesis of 3
      years as CTO and co-founder of Sbaam.com in Italy and in Ireland,
      he decided to relocate in Dublin to work as senior PHP engineer at
      Smartbox.
    description2: >
      He loves developing open source libraries and working with frameworks such
      as Symfony and Express. He is convinced that the JavaScript fame is still
      at the very beginning and that this technology will have a huge impact in
      the future of most of the web-and mobile-related technologies. For this
      reason, he spends most of his free time improving his knowledge of
      JavaScript and playing with Node.js.
